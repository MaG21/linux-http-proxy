Please follow the Linux Kernel Coding Style as much as possible.

* Please note the following points:

1. Do not place spaces after these keywords:
	if, switch, case, for, while

2. When defining a function, the returned data type must be in one line and the
function name along with the arguments in another line.

/* bad */
int function(void)
{
	/* code */
}

/* good */

int
function(void)
{
	/* code */
}

In this way, things gets more organized. When searching, is easier to discard
things, also in this way you got more room to use in the argument list of a
function that has many arguments or the freedom to choose better names for
the arguments.

3. When declaring variables, declare them in order, for example:

/* bad */
size_t length;
int b;
char c;
char *ptr;
int i;
size_t size;


/* good */
int    b;
int    i;
char   c;
char   *ptr;
size_t length;
size_t size;
