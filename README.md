# linux-http-proxy
A fast, lightweight http/https proxy server for GNU/Linux.

### Goals
	1. Security.
	2. Performance.
	3. lightweight.
	4. Clean Code.

### Lacks
	1. Portability. (GNU/Linux only)
	2. Debugging capabilities.
	3. Completeness. (Basic features only)

The main goal is to leave aside portability issues and provide a small, fast,
secure and clean HTTP/HTTPS proxy server that makes the most out of your
GNU/Linux box. Also, IPv6 will be suppported.

## NOTE
This repository uses git submodules to handle dependencies internally, if one
were to clone this repository over HTTPS, she would have to do something similar to
the following:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/MaG21/linux-http-proxy.git

This server is not done yet, I'll be working on it till I finish completly
the server.

Please, don't hesitate to contact me, send a pull request, a comment or
anything.
